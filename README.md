# 5-Day Pathogen Genomics Workshop
## For Public Health & Laboratory Professionals

Welcome to the repository for the 5-Day Pathogen Genomics Workshop. This course is designed to provide public health and laboratory professionals with a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to pathogen genomics, from sample preparation to surveillance.

**Target Audience:** Public Health & Laboratory Professionals with limited bioinformatics experience.
**Primary Analysis Platform:** [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
1.  Understand the principles of NGS technologies (Illumina & Nanopore).
2.  Perform Quality Control (QC) on raw sequencing data.
3.  Assemble bacterial genomes from short reads.
4.  Detect Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes using bioinformatic tools.
5.  Interpret phylogenetic trees for outbreak investigation.

## Repository Structure
The materials are organized by day:

*   **Day 1: Foundations**: Introduction to Genomics, Sequencing Technologies, and Galaxy basics.
*   **Day 2: Quality Control**: NGS Library Prep, QC, and Nanopore Analysis.
*   **Day 3: Assembly**: Read Mapping, De Novo Assembly, and Annotation.
*   **Day 4: AMR Detection**: Antimicrobial Resistance mechanisms and detection.
*   **Day 5: Phylogenomics**: Surveillance and Phylogenetic visualization.
