Welcome to the official repository for the **5-Day Pathogen Genomics Workshop**. This intensive course provides a hands-on journey from raw biological samples to actionable public health intelligence.

---

## 🌟 Overview
This workshop is tailored for professionals with limited bioinformatics experience, focusing on reproducible workflows using the **Galaxy Interface**. We cover the entire spectrum of pathogen genomics, including sequencing technologies, quality control, assembly, and antimicrobial resistance detection.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
*   **Sequencing Literacy**: Master the differences between Illumina and Nanopore technologies.
*   **Data Integrity**: Perform rigorous Quality Control (QC) and filtering.
*   **Genome Reconstruction**: Perform *de novo* assembly and annotation of bacterial genomes.
*   **Surveillance**: Detect AMR genes and interpret phylogenetic relationships for outbreak tracking.
