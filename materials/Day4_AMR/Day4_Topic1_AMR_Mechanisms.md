# Day 4: Topic 1
## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR): Mechanisms

---

# The Global Threat

*   AMR is a "Silent Pandemic".
*   Predicted 10 million deaths/year by 2050.
*   **Genomics allows us to:**
    1.  Predict phenotype (AST) from genotype.
    2.  Track spread of mobile resistance elements.

# Major Mechanisms

1.  **Deactivation**: The bacteria destroy the drug.
    *   *Example*: **Beta-lactamases** (CTX-M, NDM, KPC) cut the beta-lactam ring of penicillin/carbapenems.
2.  **Efflux**: The bacteria pump the drug out.
    *   *Example*: **TetA** pump removes Tetracycline.
3.  **Target Modification**: The bacteria change the drug's binding site.
    *   *Example*: **mecA** (MRSA) creates a new Penicillin Binding Protein that methicillin cannot bind to.

# Modes of Acquisition

*   **Vertical Transmission (Mutation)**
    *   passed from mother to daughter cell.
    *   evolves slowly (Point mutations).
    *   *Ex*: Tuberculosis resistance, Fluoroquinolone resistance (*gyrA*).
*   **Horizontal Gene Transfer (Acquired)**
    *   passed between neighbors (can be different species!).
    *   **Plasmids**, Transposons, Integrons.
    *   evolves rapidly.
    *   *Ex*: ESBLs in *E. coli*, Vancomycin resistance in *Enterococcus*.

# Intrinsic vs Acquired

*   **Intrinsic**: The bacteria is naturally resistant.
    *   *Klebsiella pneumoniae* has an intrinsic *blaSHV* gene.
*   **Acquired**: It picked up something new.
    *   *Klebsiella pneumoniae* acquiring *blaNDM-1*.

*Key for Public Health: Detecting acquired molecular epidemiology is crucial.*
