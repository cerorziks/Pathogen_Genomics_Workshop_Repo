We use genomics approaches to understand the way pathogens have moved, and continue to move, through populations and across continents
                       with a view to providing high-resolution insights aimed at tracking and limiting their spread.

The mobilome’s role in AMR Gene Transfer

     Transfer of DNA between bacterial cells
                                               ●   MGEs: elements that promote intracellular and
                                                   intercellular DNA mobility.


                                               ●   The concerted activity of both types of MGEs
                                                   results in Horizontal Gene Transfer.


                                               ●   Bacterial pathogens are able to meet the
                                                   evolutionary challenge of combating
                                                   antimicrobials, often by acquiring preexisting
                                                   resistance determinants from the bacterial
                                                   gene pool.


                                               ●   Widespread multidrug resistance is commonly
                                                   achieved by acquisition of preexisting
                                                   determinants followed by amplification in
                                                   response to selection.

isolates                        pandemics, mainly due to their ability to produce cholera
(VcH.9) from                    toxin. The current pandemic is associated with the
Yemen.                          emergence of V. cholerae biotype known as 7PET.

                                * V. cholerae reached Yemen in 2016, causing the largest
                                cholera outbreak in modern history.

                                * Prior genomic surveillance revealed the introduction of the
                                7PET T13 in Yemen, which was susceptible to all antibiotics.

                                * Ongoing surveillance coupled with genomics and
                                microbiology characterisation in the region between 2018 and
                                2019 documented the emergence of plasmid-mediated
                                multidrug resistance.

The Yemen MRD plasmid is spreading across the species

 Comparison of IncC plasmids pCNRVC190243 (Yemen plasmid) and pYA00120881 (plasmid from V. cholerae
 strains collected in Zimbabwe).




 * By looking for the plasmid sequence, we found instances across 7PET and Non-7PET strains, both locally and gobally.

 * We also found evidence of movement of the MDR region into the chromosome.

 * The MDR region seems to be specific of the Yemen plasmid.

Expansion of multidrug resistance in Yemeni 7PET V. cholerae isolates.




Genomic analysis of V. cholerae isolates recovered in Yemen revealed that clinical macrolide use initiated in 2016 to treat cholera preceded a shift in
V. cholerae genotype from antibiotic susceptibility to multidrug resistance between 2018 and 2019.


This was due to the spread of a newly acquired MDR plasmid conferring resistance (beige) in 7PET epidemic V. cholerae strains (blue).


This MDR plasmid was also carried by non-epidemic V. cholerae (grey) present, indicating that genetic exchange between epidemic and endemic
strains may have contributed to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

➔   Only a minority of PAE plasmid species evolved to carry resistance genes and they
    share common characteristics and evolutionary strategies.

➔   We can focus on these plasmids to enhance genomics surveillance and investigate
    what makes them good resistance vectors.

➔   Humans distorted plasmids identity, their role and the way bacteria face antibiotics.
