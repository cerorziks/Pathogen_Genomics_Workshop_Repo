  What is Targeted Sequencing??
“Targeted resequencing is a variation of re-sequencing
where only a small subset of the genome is sequenced,
 such as the exome, a particular chromosome, a set of
             genes or a region of interest”
                  Overview
• Why??
• How??
  – Hybridisation capture
  – Amplicon
• Applicability depends upon project
• Examples
     Why Targeted Sequencing?
• Cheaper £££££
• Diagnostic – particular diseases
• Detect low levels of variation
• Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
  instead of arrays
  – Rare alleles
• Genotyping

  Genome Wide Association Studies
            (GWAS)
• GWAS based on common SNPs
  – contribution of 1000’s of loci to risk for common
    diseases and to variation in quantitative traits.
  – However explain only a fraction of heritable variation -
    important role for variants not assessed in GWAS.
  – In particular, unidentified low-frequency genetic
    variants may have a major impact on complex
    phenotypes
                 Genotyping
• Multiplex enrichment PCR
  – PCR primers designed to amplify the targets of
    interest (known SNPs)
• Restriction enzyme (RE) digestion
  – Complexity of genome reduced by restriction
    digestion
  – little genome sequence is available or no prior
    SNP variants have been identified
 PCR based approaches can be very
sensitive eg Covid-19 ARTIC method

    Hybridisation Capture - Examples
•   Whole Exome
•   Pan Cancer
•   Heterogeneous disorders
•   Hearing loss with many causal genes
    – 200 to 250 genes may be involved in hereditary HL
•   Intellectual disabilities
•   Autism spectrum disorders
•   Cardiovascular disease
•   Obesity, diabetes
•   Minor allele frequencies
    – enriched for functional mutations, potentially have medical
      relevance
               Why Twist
• Fast turnaround
• Greater uniformity
• Cheaper custom panels
Twist hybrid capture for methylation




Twist has probes for both strands
Twist can produce more complex probe pools to cover all sequence combinations

The IDT and other available UDI barcoding primers will have sequence:

P5 indexing oligo
AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC[barcode]ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC*T


Your PCR primers will need Illumina flanking sequences at 5’ end compatible with these sequences so should have general design

Forward primer would have design
5’ ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT gene specific sequence 3’

Reverse primer would have design
5’ GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT gene specific sequence 3’
Using these sequences means that custom sequencing primers are not required.
                   Multiplex PCR design
• Design difficulties
      – Specificity
      – Cross primer interactions (dimers/non
        specific amplification)


• Need good design software!!
  Mprimer
      – Thorough design algorithms
      – Primer 3 input
            • Input target and surrounding sequence
            • Constrain target sizes to 190-250bp
            • Annealing temperature
