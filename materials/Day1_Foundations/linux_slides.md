Linux Tips & Tricks
▸ Linux is case sensitive
   ▸   Typing LS is NOT the same as typing ls

▸ You need to put spaces between
   ▸   a command
   ▸   the values passed to the command

       ▸   mkdir new_dir will create a new directory
       ▸   mkdirnew_dir will just give an error!


▸ Linux is not psychic! If you misspell the name of
  command or a file it will not understand you
