Operating System (OS)
▸ Software that supports the computer's basic functions
   ▸   Manages computer hardware (screen, mouse, keyboard)
   ▸   Provides tools for managing files, running software
   ▸   Provides a way via software applications to interact with the
       computer

Virtual Machine (VM)
▸ VM is a computer environment that can be run on any computer
   ▸   OS, data, software applications


▸ Allows you to run one OS (Linux) on another OS (Windows)

Virtual Machine (VM)
▸ Created a VM for this course
    ▸   Linux OS
    ▸   Data for practicals
    ▸   Bioinformatics software
        (fastqc, samtools, ariba etc.)


▸ Continue to use it after the
  course (with limitations!)

Unix/Linux
▸ What is Unix?
   ▸   Standard operating system (alternative to MS Windows, Mac OS)
   ▸   Provides a way for you to interact with the computer (through commands and scripts)
   ▸   Many ‘flavours’ of Unix, using Linux

   ▸   Many ‘flavours’ of Unix, using Linux


▸ Why use Unix/Linux?
   ▸   Output of lots of biological research exists in large text files
   ▸   Very suitable for working with such files and widely used in scientific community
   ▸   Powerful and flexible commands for processing large text files
   ▸   Saves you time, automating repetitive tasks
   ▸   Powerful and stable operating system, compatibility with most bioinformatics tools
   ▸   Flexibility and customisation, package management, open source
Using Linux



  File
Explorer
Terminals and Commandline




                            UNIX
 Terminal                  prompt
                        UNIX
                        prompt
Linux Commands
     Command   What it does
     ls        List the contents of the current directory/folder
     cd        Changes a directory/folder
     mv        Moves a file
     cp        Copies a file
     rm        Remove a file
     less      Displays the contents of a file
     head      Displays the first ten lines of a file
     tail      Displays the last ten lines of a file
     cat       Concatenate files together
     pwd       Print working directory
     mkdir     Make a new directory
ls command
Directory Structure
                                          root directory

Linux Tips & Tricks
▸ Linux is case sensitive
   ▸   Typing LS is NOT the same as typing ls

▸ You need to put spaces between
   ▸   a command
   ▸   the values passed to the command

       ▸   mkdir new_dir will create a new directory
       ▸   mkdirnew_dir will just give an error!


▸ Linux is not psychic! If you misspell the name of
  command or a file it will not understand you
Linux Practical

▸   basic linux - directory structure
▸   grep - search for occurrences that match a specific pattern
▸   awk - used for manipulating column based data
▸   For loops - repeat a process multiple times
▸   Bash scripting - record a sequence of commands (use later)
        ▸ Basic bash script
        ▸ Where to store your scripts
▸ Practical exercises are found on the VM (unix.pdf)
