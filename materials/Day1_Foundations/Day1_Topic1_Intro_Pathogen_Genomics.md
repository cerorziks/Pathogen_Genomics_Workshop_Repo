# Day 1: Topic 1
## Introduction to Pathogen Genomics

---

# What is Pathogen Genomics?

*   **Genomics**: Reading the complete DNA instruction book (genome) of an organism.
*   **Pathogen Genomics**: Specifically applying this to bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that cause disease.
*   **The Shift**: Moving from looking at *parts* of the bug (PCR, serology) to the *whole* bug (WGS).

---

# Why is it a Game Changer?

1.  **Universal Test**: One test (sequencing) can identify the species, drug resistance, and virulence factors.
2.  **Resolution**: Can distinguish between isolates that look identical by other methods.
3.  **Speed**: With technologies like Nanopore, we can go from sample to answer in hours.

# Public Health Applications

*   **Outbreak Detection**: Linking cases that are otherwise unconnected.
*   **Source Tracking**: Finding the contaminated water source or food product.
*   **AMR Surveillance**: Monitoring the spread of "superbugs" across borders.
*   **Vaccine Evaluation**: Checking if the pathogen has mutated to escape the vaccine (e.g., COVID-19 variants, Pneumococcal serotypes).

# The Central Dogma (Refresher)

*   **DNA (The Blueprint)**:
    *   Stable, double-stranded.
    *   Contains the genes.
*   **RNA (The Messenger)**:
    *   Transcribed from DNA.
    *   Dynamic and unstable.
*   **Protein (The Machine)**:
    *   Translated from RNA.
    *   Performs the cell's functions.

*In this workshop, we focus primarily on **DNA sequencing**.*
